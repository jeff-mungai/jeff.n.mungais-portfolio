      <p>
        I am a cybersecurity student with a strong focus on offensive security, aspiring to build a career in penetration testing and red teaming. My interests include identifying vulnerabilities, simulating real-world attack scenarios, and applying security best practices to strengthen organizational defenses.
      </p>
      <p>
        Through academic work, hands-on labs, and Capture the Flag (CTF) challenges, I have gained practical experience in areas such as network security, web application testing, and vulnerability assessment. I am continuously developing my skills with industry-standard tools and methodologies while expanding my knowledge of adversarial tactics and exploit development.
      </p>
      <p>
        My long-term goal is to contribute to a red team environment, where I can leverage my technical expertise and problem-solving abilities to enhance security posture and resilience against evolving threats.
